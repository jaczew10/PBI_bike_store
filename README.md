📂 DataSource: PowerBI Course (Simulated data)


ℹ This project presents an interactive sales dashboard for BikeForge, a fictional cycling products retailer. It was designed to provide quick, clear insights into sales performance, product trends, customer segmentation, and sales team results.

📊 The dashboard contains four main pages: Sales, Products, Customers, and Sales Team — each with visuals and KPIs tailored to its analysis area. Each area combines KPIs, charts, and interactive elements (filters, DAX toggles) to provide both a high-level overview and the ability to drill into specific trends.

🛠️ Data was primarily transformed in Power Query to ensure accuracy, consistency, and to create calculated columns required for DAX measures.
However, many of these transformations could also be efficiently handled at the database level using SQL, which is often a more optimal approach for large datasets.
For demonstration purposes, the project includes SQL view scripts that join and pre-aggregate data from multiple tables, reducing the amount of transformation needed inside Power BI and improving refresh performance.
